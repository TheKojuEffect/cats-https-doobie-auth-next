## Sample project using Scala 3, Cats Effect, Tagless Final, Http4s, Doobie, NextJS etc


### Getting Started

Start up sbt:

```bash
./sbt
```

Once sbt has loaded, you can start up the application

```sbtshell
> ~reStart
```

This uses revolver, which is a great way to develop and test the application.  Doing things this way the application
will be automatically rebuilt when you make code changes

To stop the app in sbt, hit the `Enter` key and then type:

```sbtshell
> reStop
```
